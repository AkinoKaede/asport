Your target may vary, please check
the [Rust Platform Support](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html) for more information.

### Extract

On Linux and macOS, you can extract the tarball with the following command:

```bash
tar -xvf asport-*.tar.xz
```

On Windows, you can extract the zip file with the following command:

```powershell
tar -xvf asport-*.zip
```

You can also use a graphical tool to extract the archive, such as built-in File Explorer on Windows, Finder on
macOS, or any third-party tools like 7-Zip.

### Install

After extracting the archive on Linux and macOS, you can install the binaries to your system with the following command:

```bash
cp asport-server /usr/local/bin
cp asport-client /usr/local/bin
```

## Configuration

### Server

You can copy the quick start configuration from the [server.quick.example.toml](./server.quick.example.toml).

If you want to learn more about the configuration, please refer to the [server.example.toml](./server.example.toml).

### Client

You can copy the quick start configuration from the [client.quick.example.toml](./client.quick.example.toml).

If you want to learn more about the configuration, please refer to the [client.example.toml](./client.example.toml).

## Run
